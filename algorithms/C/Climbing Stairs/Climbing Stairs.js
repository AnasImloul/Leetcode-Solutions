/*
DP

dp[i] represents the total number of different ways to take i steps
So, we want to get dp[n].
dp[n] = dp[n-1] + dp[n-2] because we can either take 1 or 2 steps.

We have two base cases: dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 2 because
there is one way to take 1 step and there are two ways to take 2 steps (1 step + 1 step OR 2 step)

    let dp = new Array(n + 1);
    dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 2;
    for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
    // T.C: O(N)
    // S.C: O(N)
};
