<h3 align="left"> 1967. Number of Strings That Appear as Substrings in Word</h3>
<div><p>Given an array of strings <code>patterns</code> and a string <code>word</code>, return <em>the <strong>number</strong> of strings in </em><code>patterns</code><em> that exist as a <strong>substring</strong> in </em><code>word</code>.</p>

<p>A <strong>substring</strong> is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> patterns = ["a","abc","bc","d"], word = "abc"
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
- "a" appears as a substring in "<u>a</u>bc".
- "abc" appears as a substring in "<u>abc</u>".
- "bc" appears as a substring in "a<u>bc</u>".
- "d" does not appear as a substring in "abc".
3 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> patterns = ["a","b","c"], word = "aaaaabbbbb"
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
- "a" appears as a substring in "a<u>a</u>aaabbbbb".
- "b" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbb<u>b</u>".
- "c" does not appear as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
2 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> patterns = ["a","a","a"], word = "ab"
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Each of the patterns appears as a substring in word "<u>a</u>b".
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= patterns.length &lt;= 100</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= patterns[i].length &lt;= 100</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= word.length &lt;= 100</code></li>
	<li><code>patterns[i]</code> and <code>word</code> consist of lowercase English letters.</li>
</ul>
