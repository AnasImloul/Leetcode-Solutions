<h3 align="left"> 920. Number of Music Playlists</h3>
<div><p>Your music player contains <code>n</code> different songs. You want to listen to <code>goal</code> songs (not necessarily different) during your trip. To avoid boredom, you will create a playlist so that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Every song is played <strong>at least once</strong>.</li>
	<li>A song can only be played again only if <code>k</code> other songs have been played.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given <code>n</code>, <code>goal</code>, and <code>k</code>, return <em>the number of possible playlists that you can create</em>. Since the answer can be very large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 3, goal = 3, k = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are 6 possible playlists: [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1].
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 2, goal = 3, k = 0
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are 6 possible playlists: [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], and [1, 2, 2].
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 2, goal = 3, k = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are 2 possible playlists: [1, 2, 1] and [2, 1, 2].
</pre>
