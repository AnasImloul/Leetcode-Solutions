<h3 align="left"> 1984. Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores</h3>
<div><p>You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>nums</code>, where <code>nums[i]</code> represents the score of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> student. You are also given an integer <code>k</code>.</p>

<p>Pick the scores of any <code>k</code> students from the array so that the <strong>difference</strong> between the <strong>highest</strong> and the <strong>lowest</strong> of the <code>k</code> scores is <strong>minimized</strong>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> possible difference</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [90], k = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is one way to pick score(s) of one student:
- [<strong><u>90</u></strong>]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 90 - 90 = 0.
The minimum possible difference is 0.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [9,4,1,7], k = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are six ways to pick score(s) of two students:
- [<strong><u>9</u></strong>,<strong><u>4</u></strong>,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 4 = 5.
- [<strong><u>9</u></strong>,4,<strong><u>1</u></strong>,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 1 = 8.
- [<strong><u>9</u></strong>,4,1,<strong><u>7</u></strong>]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 7 = 2.
- [9,<strong><u>4</u></strong>,<strong><u>1</u></strong>,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 4 - 1 = 3.
- [9,<strong><u>4</u></strong>,1,<strong><u>7</u></strong>]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 4 = 3.
- [9,4,<strong><u>1</u></strong>,<strong><u>7</u></strong>]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 1 = 6.
The minimum possible difference is 2.</pre>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= k &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 1000</code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
