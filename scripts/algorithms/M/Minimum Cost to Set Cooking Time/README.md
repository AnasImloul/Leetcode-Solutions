<h3 align="left"> 2162. Minimum Cost to Set Cooking Time</h3>
<div><p>A generic microwave supports cooking times for:</p>

<ul>
	<li>at least <code>1</code> second.</li>
	<li>at most <code>99</code> minutes and <code>99</code> seconds.</li>
</ul>

<p>To set the cooking time, you push <strong>at most four digits</strong>. The microwave normalizes what you push as four digits by <strong>prepending zeroes</strong>. It interprets the <strong>first</strong> two digits as the minutes and the <strong>last</strong> two digits as the seconds. It then <strong>adds</strong> them up as the cooking time. For example,</p>

<ul>
	<li>You push <code>9</code> <code>5</code> <code>4</code> (three digits). It is normalized as <code>0954</code> and interpreted as <code>9</code> minutes and <code>54</code> seconds.</li>
	<li>You push <code>0</code> <code>0</code> <code>0</code> <code>8</code> (four digits). It is interpreted as <code>0</code> minutes and <code>8</code> seconds.</li>
	<li>You push <code>8</code> <code>0</code> <code>9</code> <code>0</code>. It is interpreted as <code>80</code> minutes and <code>90</code> seconds.</li>
	<li>You push <code>8</code> <code>1</code> <code>3</code> <code>0</code>. It is interpreted as <code>81</code> minutes and <code>30</code> seconds.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are given integers <code>startAt</code>, <code>moveCost</code>, <code>pushCost</code>, and <code>targetSeconds</code>. <strong>Initially</strong>, your finger is on the digit <code>startAt</code>. Moving the finger above <strong>any specific digit</strong> costs <code>moveCost</code> units of fatigue. Pushing the digit below the finger <strong>once</strong> costs <code>pushCost</code> units of fatigue.</p>

<p>There can be multiple ways to set the microwave to cook for <code>targetSeconds</code> seconds but you are interested in the way with the minimum cost.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>minimum cost</strong> to set</em> <code>targetSeconds</code> <em>seconds of cooking time</em>.</p>

<p>Remember that one minute consists of <code>60</code> seconds.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/30/1.png" style="width: 506px; height: 210px;">
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> startAt = 1, moveCost = 2, pushCost = 1, targetSeconds = 600
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The following are the possible ways to set the cooking time.
- 1 0 0 0, interpreted as 10 minutes and 0 seconds.
&nbsp; The finger is already on digit 1, pushes 1 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), pushes 0 (with cost 1), pushes 0 (with cost 1), and pushes 0 (with cost 1).
&nbsp; The cost is: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6. This is the minimum cost.
- 0 9 6 0, interpreted as 9 minutes and 60 seconds. That is also 600 seconds.
&nbsp; The finger moves to 0 (with cost 2), pushes 0 (with cost 1), moves to 9 (with cost 2), pushes 9 (with cost 1), moves to 6 (with cost 2), pushes 6 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), and pushes 0 (with cost 1).
&nbsp; The cost is: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 12.
- 9 6 0, normalized as 0960 and interpreted as 9 minutes and 60 seconds.
&nbsp; The finger moves to 9 (with cost 2), pushes 9 (with cost 1), moves to 6 (with cost 2), pushes 6 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), and pushes 0 (with cost 1).
&nbsp; The cost is: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 9.

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/30/2.png" style="width: 505px; height: 73px;">
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> startAt = 0, moveCost = 1, pushCost = 2, targetSeconds = 76
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The optimal way is to push two digits: 7 6, interpreted as 76 seconds.
The finger moves to 7 (with cost 1), pushes 7 (with cost 2), moves to 6 (with cost 1), and pushes 6 (with cost 2). The total cost is: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6
Note other possible ways are 0076, 076, 0116, and 116, but none of them produces the minimum cost.
