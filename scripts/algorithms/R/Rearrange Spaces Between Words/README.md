<h3 align="left"> 1592. Rearrange Spaces Between Words</h3>
<div><p>You are given a string <code>text</code> of words that are placed among some number of spaces. Each word consists of one or more lowercase English letters and are separated by at least one space. It's guaranteed that <code>text</code> <strong>contains at least one word</strong>.</p>

<p>Rearrange the spaces so that there is an <strong>equal</strong> number of spaces between every pair of adjacent words and that number is <strong>maximized</strong>. If you cannot redistribute all the spaces equally, place the <strong>extra spaces at the end</strong>, meaning the returned string should be the same length as <code>text</code>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the string after rearranging the spaces</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> text = "  this   is  a sentence "
<strong>Output:</strong> "this   is   a   sentence"
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are a total of 9 spaces and 4 words. We can evenly divide the 9 spaces between the words: 9 / (4-1) = 3 spaces.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> text = " practice   makes   perfect"
<strong>Output:</strong> "practice   makes   perfect "
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are a total of 7 spaces and 3 words. 7 / (3-1) = 3 spaces plus 1 extra space. We place this extra space at the end of the string.
</pre>
