<h3 align="left"> 1626. Best Team With No Conflicts</h3>
<div><p>You are the manager of a basketball team. For the upcoming tournament, you want to choose the team with the highest overall score. The score of the team is the <strong>sum</strong> of scores of all the players in the team.</p>

<p>However, the basketball team is not allowed to have <strong>conflicts</strong>. A <strong>conflict</strong> exists if a younger player has a <strong>strictly higher</strong> score than an older player. A conflict does <strong>not</strong> occur between players of the same age.</p>

<p>Given two lists, <code>scores</code> and <code>ages</code>, where each <code>scores[i]</code> and <code>ages[i]</code> represents the score and age of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> player, respectively, return <em>the highest overall score of all possible basketball teams</em>.</p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> scores = [1,3,5,10,15], ages = [1,2,3,4,5]
<strong>Output:</strong> 34

</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> scores = [4,5,6,5], ages = [2,1,2,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 16

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= scores.length, ages.length &lt;= 1000</code></li>
	<li><code>scores.length == ages.length</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= scores[i] &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= ages[i] &lt;= 1000</code></li>
