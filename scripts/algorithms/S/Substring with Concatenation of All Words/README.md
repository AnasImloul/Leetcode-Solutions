<h3 align="left"> 30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words</h3>
<div><p>You are given a string <code>s</code> and an array of strings <code>words</code>. All the strings of <code>words</code> are of <strong>the same length</strong>.</p>

<p>A <strong>concatenated substring</strong> in <code>s</code> is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of <code>words</code> concatenated.</p>

<ul>
	<li>For example, if <code>words = ["ab","cd","ef"]</code>, then <code>"abcdef"</code>, <code>"abefcd"</code>, <code>"cdabef"</code>, <code>"cdefab"</code>, <code>"efabcd"</code>, and <code>"efcdab"</code> are all concatenated strings. <code>"acdbef"</code> is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of <code>words</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return <em>the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in </em><code>s</code>. You can return the answer in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]
<strong>Output:</strong> [0,9]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Since words.length == 2 and words[i].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 6.
The substring starting at 0 is "barfoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","foo"] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is "foobar". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar"] which is a permutation of words.
The output order does not matter. Returning [9,0] is fine too.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", words = ["word","good","best","word"]
<strong>Output:</strong> []
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Since words.length == 4 and words[i].length == 4, the concatenated substring has to be of length 16.
There is no substring of length 16 is s that is equal to the concatenation of any permutation of words.
We return an empty array.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "barfoofoobarthefoobarman", words = ["bar","foo","the"]
<strong>Output:</strong> [6,9,12]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Since words.length == 3 and words[i].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 9.
The substring starting at 6 is "foobarthe". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar","the"] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is "barthefoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","the","foo"] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 12 is "thefoobar". It is the concatenation of ["the","foo","bar"] which is a permutation of words.
