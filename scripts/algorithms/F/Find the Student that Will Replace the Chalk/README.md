<h3 align="left"> 1894. Find the Student that Will Replace the Chalk</h3>
<div><p>There are <code>n</code> students in a class numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. The teacher will give each student a problem starting with the student number <code>0</code>, then the student number <code>1</code>, and so on until the teacher reaches the student number <code>n - 1</code>. After that, the teacher will restart the process, starting with the student number <code>0</code> again.</p>

<p>You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>chalk</code> and an integer <code>k</code>. There are initially <code>k</code> pieces of chalk. When the student number <code>i</code> is given a problem to solve, they will use <code>chalk[i]</code> pieces of chalk to solve that problem. However, if the current number of chalk pieces is <strong>strictly less</strong> than <code>chalk[i]</code>, then the student number <code>i</code> will be asked to <strong>replace</strong> the chalk.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>index</strong> of the student that will <strong>replace</strong> the chalk</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> chalk = [5,1,5], k = 22
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation: </strong>The students go in turns as follows:
- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 17.
- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 16.
- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 11.
- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 6.
- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 5.
- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 0.
Student number 0 does not have enough chalk, so they will have to replace it.</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> chalk = [3,4,1,2], k = 25
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation: </strong>The students go in turns as follows:
- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 22.
- Student number 1 uses 4 chalk so k = 18.
- Student number 2 uses 1 chalk so k = 17.
- Student number 3 uses 2 chalk so k = 15.
- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 12.
- Student number 1 uses 4 chalk so k = 8.
- Student number 2 uses 1 chalk so k = 7.
- Student number 3 uses 2 chalk so k = 5.
- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 2.
Student number 1 does not have enough chalk, so they will have to replace it.
