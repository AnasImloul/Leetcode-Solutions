<h3 align="left"> 1475. Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop</h3>
<div><p>Given the array <code>prices</code> where <code>prices[i]</code> is the price of the <code>ith</code> item in a shop. There is a special discount for items in the shop, if you buy the <code>ith</code> item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to <code>prices[j]</code> where <code>j</code> is the <strong>minimum</strong>&nbsp;index such that <code>j &gt; i</code> and <code>prices[j] &lt;= prices[i]</code>, otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.</p>

<p><em>Return an array where the <code>ith</code> element is the final price you will pay for the <code>ith</code> item of the shop considering the special discount.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> [4,2,4,2,3]
<strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;
For item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[1]=4, therefore, the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4.&nbsp;
For item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2.&nbsp;
For item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4.&nbsp;
For items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
<strong>Output:</strong> [1,2,3,4,5]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In this case, for all items, you will not receive any discount at all.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> prices = [10,1,1,6]
<strong>Output:</strong> [9,0,1,6]
</pre>
