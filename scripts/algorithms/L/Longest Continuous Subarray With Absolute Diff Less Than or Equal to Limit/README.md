<h3 align="left"> 1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit</h3>
<div><p>Given an array of integers <code>nums</code> and an integer <code>limit</code>, return the size of the longest <strong>non-empty</strong> subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to <code>limit</code><em>.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4
<strong>Output:</strong> 2 
<strong>Explanation:</strong> All subarrays are: 
[8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 &lt;= 4.
[8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 &gt; 4. 
[8,2,4] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 &gt; 4.
[8,2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 &gt; 4.
[2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 &lt;= 4.
[2,4] with maximum absolute diff |2-4| = 2 &lt;= 4.
[2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |2-7| = 5 &gt; 4.
[4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 &lt;= 4.
[4,7] with maximum absolute diff |4-7| = 3 &lt;= 4.
[7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 &lt;= 4. 
Therefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [10,1,2,4,7,2], limit = 5
<strong>Output:</strong> 4 
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The subarray [2,4,7,2] is the longest since the maximum absolute diff is |2-7| = 5 &lt;= 5.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2], limit = 0
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
</pre>

	<li><code>0 &lt;= limit &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li>
