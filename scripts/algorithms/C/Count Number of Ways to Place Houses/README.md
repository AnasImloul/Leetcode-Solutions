<h3 align="left"> 2320. Count Number of Ways to Place Houses</h3>
<div><p>There is a street with <code>n * 2</code> <strong>plots</strong>, where there are <code>n</code> plots on each side of the street. The plots on each side are numbered from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. On each plot, a house can be placed.</p>

<p>Return <em>the number of ways houses can be placed such that no two houses are adjacent to each other on the same side of the street</em>. Since the answer may be very large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.</p>

<p>Note that if a house is placed on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> plot on one side of the street, a house can also be placed on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> plot on the other side of the street.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
