<h3 align="left"> 913. Cat and Mouse</h3>
<div><p>A game on an <strong>undirected</strong> graph is played by two players, Mouse and Cat, who alternate turns.</p>

<p>The graph is given as follows: <code>graph[a]</code> is a list of all nodes <code>b</code> such that <code>ab</code> is an edge of the graph.</p>

<p>The mouse starts at node <code>1</code> and goes first, the cat starts at node <code>2</code> and goes second, and there is a hole at node <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>During each player's turn, they <strong>must</strong> travel along one&nbsp;edge of the graph that meets where they are.&nbsp; For example, if the Mouse is at node 1, it <strong>must</strong> travel to any node in <code>graph[1]</code>.</p>

<p>Additionally, it is not allowed for the Cat to travel to the Hole (node 0.)</p>

<p>Then, the game can end in three&nbsp;ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If ever the Cat occupies the same node as the Mouse, the Cat wins.</li>
	<li>If ever the Mouse reaches the Hole, the Mouse wins.</li>
	<li>If ever a position is repeated (i.e., the players are in the same position as a previous turn, and&nbsp;it is the same player's turn to move), the game is a draw.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given a <code>graph</code>, and assuming both players play optimally, return</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1</code>&nbsp;if the mouse wins the game,</li>
	<li><code>2</code>&nbsp;if the cat wins the game, or</li>
	<li><code>0</code>&nbsp;if the game is a draw.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>3 &lt;= graph.length &lt;= 50</code></li>
	<li><code>1&nbsp;&lt;= graph[i].length &lt; graph.length</code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= graph[i][j] &lt; graph.length</code></li>
	<li><code>graph[i][j] != i</code></li>
	<li><code>graph[i]</code> is unique.</li>
	<li>The mouse and the cat can always move.&nbsp;</li>
